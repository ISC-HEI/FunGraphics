# The FunGraphics library

A library used for teaching computer science in the [ISC](https://www.hevs.ch/isc) degree programme, notably for the course _101.1 Imperative programming_.

The documentation is available [here](https://isc-hei.github.io/FunGraphics/hevs/graphics/index.html). It is automatically built and published each time a new version tag is added to the repo.

## Origin

This library has been developed orginally by P.-A. Mudry for the [`PImp`](https://isc.hevs.ch/learn/courses/101-1) and [`inf1`](https://inf1.begincoding.net) courses given at the _School of engineering_ [HES-SO Valais//Wallis](https://www.hevs.ch).

## Compiling

For releasing a new version, once everything has been tested, locally run

* UNIX-like (Linux, MacOS X, ...) : ```./gradlew build```
* Windows : ```gradlew.bat build```

results :

| File                                 | Description                                                         |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `build/fungraphics-dev.jar`          | The latest build of the library, constant name, useful for testing. |
| `build/libs/fungraphics-VERSION.jar` | The same file with a [versioned](#Version) name.                    |

## How to release (and have a nice version number)

1. `git commit`
2. `git tag -a MAJOR.MINOR.SUB -m "tag vMAJOR.MINOR.SUB"`
3. `git push origin MAJOR.MINOR.SUB`
4. This commits everyhing and tags it adequately. When this has been done, you can then draft a new release and upload the corresponding `jar` file from above in GitHub releases. Creating a tag triggers the documentation update. Voil√†, you're all set !

## Version numbers in Scala

The version numbering used in the file name and available using `FunGraphics.version()` is
generated by inspecting the git state (see [com.palantir.git-version](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-git-version)
for details). However, the commit should be tagged accordingly.

Here is an example : `1.5.7-3-g2aabbbf.dirty`

* `1.5.7` is the last tag
* `-3-` we are 3 commits after the tag
* `g2aabbbf` : git short hash
* `.dirty` : some changes are not committed
